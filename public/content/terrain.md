# What bike should I choose for where I want to ride?

This page is supposed to help you pick out a bike that fits your desired riding style.  It does not include every motorcycle or every riding style known to man, but it can help you get started.

## Short distances
If you plan on only riding in your city limits and not every taking freeways, a *Mini* bike would be a great fit.  Mini bikes have great gas mileage, are easy to learn, and don't have too much power so they will not overwhelm.

If you plan on going a little further, maybe a short distance out of your city limits, or have to be on the bike for longer periods of time, a *Standard* bike may be a good starting point.  These have bigger engines than minis, are more comfortable for longer periods of time, and are much more versatile.  However, they don't have all the bells and whistles of some of the other street bikes.  

If a standard bike doesn't have enough power for you, you may want to look into a *Sport* bike.  These will be faster and have some features like a windshield compared to a standard bike, but won't be quite as comfortable.  Keep in mind that the power can be a bit too much for a beginner, so maybe one of the less powerful models would be a good place to start.  

## Longer trips

If you'd prefer more comfort over speed, than a *Cruiser* might be the bike for you.  These are some of the most popular motorcycles in the world due to their comfort, relative ease to ride, and also due to the large communities of riders.  These cruisers are very heavy and can be very expensive, so keep that in mind when selecting a bike.

If you want to make extremely long road trips on your motorcycle, a *Touring* or *Sport Touring* bike will be the way to go. These bikes come with all sorts of comforts, from luggage compartments to heated seats and cup holders. They are even more expensive and heavier than a cruiser, but if extreme comfort for long distances is what you want, then find a touring bike for you. 

If you are someone who wants to explore, camp, and find new trails, then the *Adventure* bikes are what you're looking for.  These bikes are similar to the touring bikes with luggage racks, windshields, and comfortable suspension, but they also have some limited off-road capabilities.  If where you're going takes you on some mountain roads along with some dirt trails, adventure bikes will be the way to go.  

## Rougher Terrain

Sometimes the adventure bike isn't as adventurous as you need.  If that's the case, *Dual Sport* or *Enduro* bikes will get you where you want to go.  These bikes have minimal comforts, are lightweight, and are great at most off-road trails while still being a street-legal bike.  However, these are stuck inbetween two worlds; it has stripped away too many comforts to be a fantastic road bike while also being a bit too heavy and big to handle the hardest off-road trails.  If you don't plan on pushing your limits on trails and don't mind the slightly uncomfortable ride on the road, this is the bike for you.  

However, if you only plan on riding off-road, then *Dirt bikes* are the best choice hands down.  These bikes are meant to be taken out to the mountains, desert, or motocross track for some off-road fun.  They aren't street legal, so you will need a way to transport them to your destination.  Once there, they'll be able to handle any terrain you might throw at them.  Different dirt bikes have different strengths, so depending on where you'll be riding you'll want to find a bike that fits that style best.
